Contributing
------------

We're shooting for **MVP** and we need your help! You can take a look through the [issues](https://github.com/sfbrigade/brigadehub/issues) on this repo, and look for any issues tagged ***[`help wanted`](https://github.com/sfbrigade/brigadehub/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+needed%22)***, those are things you can hop in and contribute without much coordination. Other issues are definitely welcome for contributions, but would require more coordination with me to ensure we're using the same data structures moving forward.

To coordinate with the current team or for help in installing/running, join us on [SFBrigade Slack](http://c4a.me/cfsfslack) on the `#brigadehub` channel, or reach out to me on the `#sfbrigade` IRC channel on freenode.

## Contribution Guidelines

If something is unclear, confusing, or needs to be refactored, please let me know.
Pull requests are always welcome, however, please open an issue before
submitting a pull request. This project uses
[feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) with a
few minor exceptions. If you are submitting a pull request that involves
Jade templates, please make sure you are using *spaces*, not tabs. Please also ensure
your styling matches the `.csscomb.json` file included with the project.
